        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Theyâ€™re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
      <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
