        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
      <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

        <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
        <li>Once the changes are added and committed locally, use git pull origin main to sure our local branch is up to date before pushing up our changes.</li>
      <li>To sink your work with GitHub: 1. git add -A, 2. 

        git commit -m “updated project README file” ,

        git pull origin main, 
        4. git push origin feature/project-README</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
      <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts.</li> 
      <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
      <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
